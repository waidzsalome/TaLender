# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Talender is a platform to offer, discover, and connect around skills. Users create a profile, list the skills they offer, and select the skills they seek. 
A discovery feed returns recommended users/skills; users can like/dislike others and a match is formed upon mutual like. Matched users can chat. 


Note: User stories below are the authoritative requirements; some (e.g., moderation, notifications, location) are partially or not yet implemented in code and will be planned for upcoming sprints.
